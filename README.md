### What I learned

I've learned to use `::before` and `::after` in this project

I also had issues with the image overlay:
I knew I needed to use `position: absolute` but I couldn't figure out why it was applying it to the size of the body of my page.

And I figured that the parent didn't have a `position: relative`

This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=exb2ab72Xhs) helped me figure it out!

_I will be honest, I had to look up a couple of tutorials for that one mistake_

## Acknowledgments

Since I had issues with the overlay, I wanted to check tutorials or solutions that could help figure this out and that's where I'll give a big thanks to [Lucas](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/correlucas)'s solution which redirected me towards a useful tutorial he mentioned in his own solution.
